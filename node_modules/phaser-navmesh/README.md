## Changelog

Version 2.3.0

- Fix: webpack misconfiguration that caused [issue 37](https://github.com/mikewesthad/navmesh/issues/37). The build was only picking up the "default" export, but now it properly picks up all library exports. Thanks to[@Wenish](https://github.com/Wenish).

Version 2.2.2

- Update all dependencies to the latest versions.
- Fixed TS bug where constructor was missing `pluginKey` which is required in latest version of Phaser. 

Version 2.2.1

- Fix: `PhaserNavMeshPlugin#buildMeshFromTilemap` mesh output is no longer incorrectly rotated (rows & cols were flipped).
  
Version 2.2.0

- Feature: `PhaserNavMeshPlugin#buildMeshFromTilemap` allows you to automatically generate a navmesh from a Tilemap.
- Feature: `PhaserNavMesh#isPointInMesh` allows you to check if a point is inside of the navmesh.
